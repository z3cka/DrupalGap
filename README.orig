DrupalGap bridges the gap between Drupal and mobile device applications. This
open source project is built around PhoneGap and utilizes the power of JQuery,
JQuery Mobile and of course Drupal.

DrupalGap consists of two parts:

|=========================================|
| DrupalGap - Drupal Module (6.x and 7.x) |
|=========================================|

http://drupal.org/project/drupalgap

This module allows mobile applications to utilize the power of Drupal websites.
DrupalGap exposes Drupal's content and user features to mobile devices through
the DrupalGap mobile application, or through your own custom mobile application.
Leveraging the power of existing Drupal modules such as Views and Services,
DrupalGap integrates mobile device applications with Drupal.

|================================|
| DrupalGap - Mobile Application |
|================================|

https://github.com/signalpoint/DrupalGap

The DrupalGap mobile application can be installed on a mobile device and connect
to Drupal websites running the DrupalGap module. Once connected, the mobile
device can utilize that Drupal site's content and user features. Developers can
use the open source DrupalGap project on GitHub to create custom mobile
applications in PhoneGap that communicate with their Drupal websites.

The mobile application is available in the Android marketplace.

integrates with your Drupal website.

|======================================================|
| Developing with Localhost Drupal & Android Emulators |
|======================================================|

If you are developing in a localhost environment, and normally access your
Drupal site in a web browser through e.g. http://localhost/my_drupal_site, you
will most likely need to connect to http://10.0.2.2/my_drupal_site inside the
Android emulator to communicate with your localhost Drupal install!
